          <p>EPICS in Curriculum</p>
        </div>
         <div>Initially EPICS was a non-credit programme and was carried out for six hours in a week where the students were motivated to come voluntarily and work on the societal issues that they identified. Students went for a survey in their first year and identified the problems in villages and they started working on the solutions. To carry out this programme faculty got trained from Dr. William Oakes, Director of EPICS,Purdue University, Using online and offline mode. Initially an EPICS workshop was conducted by Dr.Oakes to get a basic idea, and 15 faculty got certified on Design Thinking, a six-month course. 15 faculty are the mentors for the students. In April 2018 Vardhaman has signed an MOU with EPICS in IEEE and EPICS, Purdue University to make V-EPICS a part of curriculum. As a result,now EPICS has become a part of our Curriculum with four courses in the R18 regulations and revised year by year improving the content and also the making the things better for learning.</div>

    <div class="section-title">
      <p>THE CONTEXT</p>
    </div>
    The major challenge is to bring the two groups together in a mutually beneficial way (the Students and the Community). It was specifically to address this challenge that the V-EPICS programme was launched.
    <br>The V-EPICS programme connects engineering with community service in four verticals of community improvement effort as defined by EPICS in IEEE:<br>
    <br>
    <ul class="faq-list" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">

        <div data-bs-toggle="collapse" class="collapsed question" href="#faq1">Access and Abilities <i class="bi bi-chevron-down icon-show"></i><i class="bi bi-chevron-up icon-close"></i></div>
        <div id="faq1" class="collapse" data-bs-parent=".faq-list">
          <p>
            By bringing together student branches at universities, secondary students and non-profit organizations, there is a greater ability to solve accessibility issues within communities. As students learn to help their community or country through engineering projects, non-profit organizations establish themselves in order to maintain new and profound change. The Access and Abilities projects help enable adaptive services, clinics for those in need (such as children with disabilities), me for adults and assistive technologies.
          </p>

        <div id="faq2" class="collapse" data-bs-parent=".faq-list">
          <p>
            To help young students and to discover the benefits of science, math, technology and engineering for their future, many projects give students hands-on experience in order to stimulate their interests in those fields. Communities and schools lacking in strong engineering programmes gain new curriculum along with new facilities in which to explore new areas of the topic.

          <p>
            Engineering and science are key solutions to answering environmental issues. The evolution of technology brings changes in the environment creating  the need for sustainability, with new ways to create electricity and energy, recycling and the use of renewable energy sources.
