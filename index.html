              Vardhaman College of Engineering has been following EPICS
              curriculum from 2015. The EPICS courses are offered as a part of
              the collaboration between Vardhaman College of Engineering and
              Purdue University. EPICS (Engineering Projects in Community
              Service) is a unique program that allows teams of undergraduate
              students to design, build, and deploy real systems to solve
              engineering problems for local community service and educational
              organizations.

          <div>
            Initially EPICS was a non-credit programme and was carried out for
            six hours in a week where the students were motivated to come
            voluntarily and work on the societal issues that they identified.
            Students went for a survey in their first year and identified the
            problems in villages and they started working on the solutions. To
            carry out this programme faculty got trained from Dr. William Oakes,
            Director of EPICS,Purdue University, Using online and offline mode.
            Initially an EPICS workshop was conducted by Dr.Oakes to get a basic
            idea, and 15 faculty got certified on Design Thinking, a six-month
            course. 15 faculty are the mentors for the students. In April 2018
            Vardhaman has signed an MOU with EPICS in IEEE and EPICS, Purdue
            University to make V-EPICS a part of curriculum. As a result,now
            EPICS has become a part of our Curriculum with four courses in the
            R18 regulations and revised year by year improving the content and
            also the making the things better for learning.

          The major challenge is to bring the two groups together in a mutually
          beneficial way (the Students and the Community). It was specifically
          to address this challenge that the V-EPICS programme was launched.
          <br />The V- EPICS programme connects engineering with community
          service in four verticals of community improvement effort as defined
          by EPICS in IEEE:<br />

                  By bringing together student branches at universities,
                  secondary students and non-profit organizations, there is a
                  greater ability to solve accessibility issues within
                  communities. As students learn to help their community or
                  country through engineering projects, non-profit organizations
                  establish themselves in order to maintain new and profound
                  change. The Access and Abilities projects help enable adaptive
                  services, clinics for those in need (such as children with
                  disabilities), me for adults and assistive technologies.

                  To help young students and to discover the benefits of
                  science, math, technology and engineering for their future,
                  many projects give students hands-on experience in order to
                  stimulate their interests in those fields. Communities and
                  schools lacking in strong engineering programmes gain new
                  curriculum along with new facilities in which to explore new
                  areas of the topic.
